// Working on string problem in codewars


/*
Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings.

-- We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2 ... z = 26.

For example, for the word "zodiacs", solve("zodiacs") = 26
-- The consonant substrings are: "z", "d" and "cs" and the values are z = 26, d = 4 and cs = 3 + 19 = 22. The highest is 26.

For the word "strength", solve("strength") = 57
-- The consonant substrings are: "str" and "ngth" with values "str" = 19 + 20 + 18 = 57 and "ngth" = 14 + 7 + 20 + 8 = 49. The highest is 57.
Vowels are are a,e,i,o,u.

For C: do not mutate input.

More examples in test cases. Good luck!
